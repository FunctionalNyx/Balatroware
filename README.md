If for some reason you actually want to do this...

It requires some permission editing
(I haven't made it so it gives itself permissions yet)

# Proceed at your own risk

Step 1: Download the code and install the mod and shit. If you dont know how to do this please go to the Steammodded page.

Step 2: Go to C:\Windows and... bear with me here

Step 3: Right click on System32, go to properties and then the security tab.

Step 4: Click on Advanced and then Change (Next to Owner: TrustedInstaller)

Step 5: Put 'Administrators' in the object name then click 'Check Names'

Step 6: Then press okay and apply or whatever and stuff. A window should pop up and if there are any errors probably disregard them it should be okaaaay

Step 7: Edit permissions and allow full control to Users

Step 8: Click apply and launch the mod. And hopefully you're doing this on a virtual machine because god cant save you now
